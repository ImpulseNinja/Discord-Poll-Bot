# Discord-Poll-Bot
Discord Bot to create polls with custom or default emojis

This bot is written using the Discord API for Python.

The Bot Token is a unique token, hidden using a text (not upploaded here) file. This is to allow the program to connect with the Discord Bot and thus remains hidden but can be replaced with a different Discord Bot Token.

This text file method is also used for the makeshift error handler, which sends the message that threw an error to user_id provided (this can be accessed using the developer options in discord and the copy id option). To keep this account private the user id for my account has been grabbed via aa text file.
