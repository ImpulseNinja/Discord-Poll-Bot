# Discord-Poll-Bot
Discord Bot to create polls with custom or default emojis

This bot is written using the Discord API for Python.

The Bot Token is a unique token, hidden using an environment file and the os library for Python. This is to allow the program to connect with the Discord Bot and thus remains hidden but can be replaced with a different Discord Bot Token.
